```{r setup, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
options(scipen = 1, digits = 5)
```

```{r knitr_setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, message = FALSE, 
               echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE)
```

A user of [`read_regnie()`](http://edild.github.io/regnie/) pointed me to some problems with few raster files that could not be read.
It turned out that the function could not read rasters with a precipitation greater than 99 mm.
The bug was fixed and the function is now also 4.5x faster than the old one.

Check our the new version on [github](https://github.com/EDiLD/esmisc).

I will also submit `esmisc` shortly to CRAN.
