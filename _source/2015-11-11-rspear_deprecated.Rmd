After being around for three years ([here's](http://edild.github.io/rspear1/) the release post),
[rspear](https://github.com/EDiLD/rspear) is now deprecated.

`rspear` is out-of-date; development and maintenance has stopped. 
Functionality of functions and updates of traits cannot be guaranteed any more!

On CRAN the package will be [archived](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/webchem/) and I also will keep the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EDiLD/rspear) for future references.


Please use the new SPEAR Calculator available [here](http://www.systemecology.eu/spearcalc/), to calculate SPEAR.


**Query:**

* **Did anybody use rspear?** -  If so ping me on twitter, raise an issue on GitHub or send me an Email.
