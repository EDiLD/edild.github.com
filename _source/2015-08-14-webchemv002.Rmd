A new version of the webchem package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/webchem/index.html).

### Allan Woods database
The biggest visible change is the implementation of `allanwood()`, which queries data from [Allan Woods Compendium of Pesticides](http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides). 
You can query his database via the common name or the CAS:
```{r, message=FALSE}
require(webchem)
allanwood('Fluazinam', type = 'commonname')
allanwood('79622-59-6', type = 'cas')$cname
```

### Other changes
All other changes are under the hood:

* fixing problems with `NA` handling
* the functions now return `NA` if the server is not reachable
* misc bug fixes
* Addition of unit tests
* Improved documentation
* Some function now check the user input.
