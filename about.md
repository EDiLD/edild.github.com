I am a PhD student at the University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany, working in the <a href="https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/en/campus-landau/faculty7/environmental-sciences/landscape-ecology?set_language=en" target="_blank">Quantitative Landscape Ecology Group</a>. 
Although, many of my posts are related to my work, anything I write here does not in any way represent the views of the University of Koblenz-Landau.

My research encompasses **Quantitative Ecotoxicology** (Statistics for Ecotoxicology), **Pollution of streams** (mainly studying pesticides) and the **Effects** of these to communities in the field. 

As an Environmental Scientist I need to have knowledge from very different disciplines, and so is also the software I am comfortable with: 
<br>
from storage (*PostgreSQL*), to spatial (*QGIS, GrassGIS, PostGIS*), to programming (*R, Python, bash*), to statistics (*R*), to presentation (*LaTeX, markdown*).
</p>

<p>
Since November 2015 I also work as a part-time freelance scientist \& consultant. Main topics are data sourcing (web scraping), data cleaning, data analysis of environmental and ecological data. Moreover, I give course on ecological statistics using the software "R".
Feel free to contact me, if you're interested.

<p>
I learned a lot from online resources and  would like to give something back.  
I am an active member of the <a href="http://forum.r-statistik.de/index.php" target="_blank">german R-community</a>, but you can also find me on stackoverflow.
