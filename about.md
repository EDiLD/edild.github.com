I am a PhD student at the University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany, working within the <a href="https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/en/campus-landau/faculty7/environmental-sciences/landscape-ecology?set_language=en" target="_blank">Quantitative Landscape Ecology Group</a>. 
Although, many of the posts are related to my PhD work, anything I write here does not in any way represent the views of the University of Koblenz-Landau.

My research encompasses **Quantitative Ecotoxicology** (Statistics for Ecotoxicology), **Pollution of streams** (mainly studying pesticides) and the **Effects** of these to communities in the field. 
As an Environmental Scientist I need to have knowledge from very different disciplines, and so is also the software I am comfortable with: 
<br>
From storage (*PostgreSQL*), to spatial (*QGIS, GrassGIS, PostGIS*), to programming (*R, Python, bash*), to statistics (*R*), to presentation (*LaTeX, markdown*).
</p>


<p>
I learned a lot from online resources and  would like to give something back.  
I am an active member of the <a href="http://forum.r-statistik.de/index.php" target="_blank">german R-community</a>, but you can also find me on stackoverflow. 
<br>
Moreover, I am a freelance R consultant with background in ecology and eco(-toxico)logy.
