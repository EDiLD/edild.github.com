A user of [`read_regnie()`](http://edild.github.io/regnie/) pointed me to some problems with few raster files that could not be read.
It turned out that the function could not read rasters with a precipitation greater than 99 mm.
The bug was fixed and the function is now also 4.5x faster than the old one.
 
Check our the new version on [github](https://github.com/EDiLD/esmisc).
 
I will also submit `esmisc` shortly to CRAN.
